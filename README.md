`baton-slack-enterprise` is a connector for Slack built using the [Baton SDK](https://github.com/conductorone/baton-sdk). It communicates with the Slack API to sync data about workspaces, users, user groups, and channels.

Check out [Baton](https://github.com/conductorone/baton) to learn more the project in general.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Slack app. You can follow [this Slack quickstart guide](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics).
2. Set needed Bot Token Scopes for the app: 
  - channels:join
  - channels:read
  - groups:read
  - team:read
  - usergroups:read
  - users.profile:read
  - users:read
  - users:read.email
3. Install the app to your workspace.
4. Use Bot User OAuth Token as token in `baton-slack-enterprise`.

For the enterprise grid plan the same rules apply for creating an app. There is 
a difference in setting scopes, for applications that will be installed on 
organization level, User Token Scopes should be set as well as bot scopes. User 
Token is used for Admin API needed to sync additional resources in the enterprise.
Additional scopes for User Token are:
  - admin
  - admin.roles:read
  - admin.teams:read
  - admin.usergroups:read
  - admin.users:read

For provisioning you will need this scope.
  - admin.users:write

5. **Permissions for User Activation/Deactivation Actions**: To use the enable_user and disable_user actions, you need:
  - An Enterprise Grid token with admin permissions in order to access the SCIM API
  - See [Slack SCIM API Permissions](https://docs.slack.dev/admins/scim-api/#permissions) for more details 

Other difference is in the way the application is installed, on enterprise grid 
app should be installed on the Organization level and on all the Workspaces from 
which you want to sync the resources. The installation has to be done by Admin 
or Owner of an Enterprise Grid organization. More info with an example is 
available in the [Slack API Docs](https://api.slack.com/methods/admin.teams.list#markdown).
To work with Enterprise Grid APIs use User OAuth Token passed as 
`--enterprise-token` along with the Bot User OAuth Token passed via `--token` flag.
To work with GovSlack instances use `--gov-env` flag along with the `--enterprise-token`.

# Data Model

`baton-slack-enterprise` pulls down information about the following Slack resources:
- Workspaces
- Users
- User Groups
- Channels
- Workspace roles

Enterprise grid additional resources:
- Enterprise roles

With SSO configured (enterprise grid):
- IDP groups

If you have SSO configured for your enterprise grid organization you can also 
sync IDP groups and provision them. Just pass the `--sso-enabled=true` flag.
